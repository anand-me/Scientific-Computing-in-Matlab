The repository is dedicated to the work done on investigation of *Transition to turbulence in oscillating flows.* This work was done at CNRS laboratory Institut Pprime, Poitiers, France during November 2018 to February 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Hélène Baillet and Dr. Islam Ramadan.

The objective of the project was to compare the two sets of velocity measurements made at a different Reynolds number using different measurement techniques, PIV (Particle image velocimetry) and LDA (Laser Doppler Anemometry). The comparison had helped us to access the performance of these two optical methods to capture the transition of turbulence in oscillating flows and had given more insight into physics underlying the phenomenon of transition of turbulence in oscillating flows.
